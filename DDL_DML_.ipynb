        "#### Overview\n",
        "**Data Definition Language (DDL)** and **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** are two fundamental components of SQL used for managing and manipulating databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **DDL (Data Definition Language) Commands**\n",
        "\n",
        "DDL commands are used to define and manage the structure of database objects. Here are some key DDL commands:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **CREATE**: Used to create database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and more.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
        "         EmployeeID INT,\n",
        "         FirstName VARCHAR(255),\n",
        "         LastName VARCHAR(255),\n",
        "         Department VARCHAR(255)\n",
        "     );\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **ALTER**: Used to modify the structure of an existing database object.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
        "     ADD Salary INT;\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **DROP**: Used to delete an entire object or part of an object from the database.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **TRUNCATE**: Used to delete all records from a table but does not remove the table structure.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **RENAME**: Used to rename an existing database object.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     RENAME TABLE Employees TO Staff;\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **DML (Data Manipulation Language) Commands**\n",
        "\n",
        "DML commands are used to manipulate data within a database. Key DML commands include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **INSERT**: Used to add new records to a database table.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department)\n",
        "     VALUES (1, 'John', 'Smith', 'IT');\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **UPDATE**: Used to modify existing records in a database table.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     UPDATE Employees\n",
        "     SET Salary = 50000\n",
        "     WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **DELETE**: Used to delete existing records from a database table.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     DELETE FROM Employees\n",
        "     WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **SELECT**: Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     SELECT * FROM Employees;\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **MERGE**: Used to combine data from two or more tables into one.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     MERGE INTO TargetTable AS target\n",
        "     USING SourceTable AS source\n",
        "     ON target.ID = source.ID\n",
        "     WHEN MATCHED THEN\n",
        "         UPDATE SET target.value = source.value\n",
        "     WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN\n",
        "         INSERT (ID, value) VALUES (source.ID, source.value);\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **CALL**: Used to call a stored procedure or function.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```sql\n",
        "     CALL UpdateEmployeeSalary(1, 50000);\n",
        "     ```\n",

        "\n",
        "- **DDL Commands**:\n",
        "  - Define and manage database structures.\n",
        "  - Ensure data integrity by defining constraints and relationships.\n",
        "  - Control database access by creating and modifying users and permissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **DML Commands**:\n",
        "  - Manipulate data efficiently.\n",
        "  - Ensure accurate and up-to-date data in the database.\n",
        "  - Support complex queries and data retrieval operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Best Practices**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use Specific DDL Statements**: Avoid unintended side effects by being specific (e.g., `DROP TABLE` instead of `DROP DATABASE`).\n",
        "- **Use Transactions for Multiple Changes**: Ensure atomicity and consistency of multiple changes.\n",
        "- **Avoid DDL in Stored Procedures**: Prevent unintentional side effects and maintain clarity.\n",
        "- **Validate DML Operations**: Ensure data changes are valid and appropriate for the current database state.\n",
        "- **Regular Backups**: Protect against data loss and ensure recovery options are available.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **DDL**: Used for defining and modifying database structures.\n",
        "- **DML**: Used for manipulating and querying data.\n",
        "- Both DDL and DML are essential for effective database management and operation.\n",
